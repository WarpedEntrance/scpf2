# Joining the Foundation
Have you been watching over members conducting duties on-site and an interest has been sparked inside of you making you want to join the Foundation? Great! We would love for you to come join the family. It’s really simple, especially because you landed on this website that contains all the answers you will need for application and quiz questions.

There are two paths to join the Foundation: a short application inside our [Application Center](https://www.roblox.com/games/751327351) or a quiz testing your knowledge on the main menu of the Foundation’s main site ([Area-14](https://www.roblox.com/games/651474220)). Applications will be reviewed by Level 3 personnel who will determine if your application was good or not. If it was, you will be ranked accordingly within the Foundation’s [Roblox group](https://www.roblox.com/groups/3069549) to clearance Level 0. For quiz submissions, you will be ranked instantly (automatically) if successful to clearance Level 0.

For more information on applications, [click here](/applications/applications.html).

{: .caution }
Remember to join the Foundation’s Roblox group before submitting an application or quiz. If you do not, you will not be ranked.
