# Foreword
The Special Containment Procedures Foundation is a marvellous place to be a member of - there is no doubt about that. Still, it is necessary to set some ground rules for all members to follow.

Imagine a group without any laws, guidelines, or regulations. At first, it may seem like a positive feature; if there are no rules, then I am not conditioned, thus making me completely free. Needless to say, there is another consequence to such an environment, an aspect most do not take into account; there are no rules for me, but the others are not conditioned either. If they are completely free, then a conflict between my freedom and their freedom is bound to happen.

This is why it is vital for the rules, guidelines, and information outlined within this website to be followed at all times. While these rules may seem like a lot to take in at first, they are easy to get used to. They are not set out to harm your experience being a member of the Foundation, but is it due to the fact all community members should be getting along in harmony and complete duties to a high level of quality. Those who choose to simply ignore information outlined within this website will be subject to disciplinary action as a result. Stating that you just “did not know” is not a valid excuse.
